# React + Vite :-
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Run Command :-
- npm install
- npm run dev


## Project Details :
- There a proper comment over each function to understand the purpose of that function.
- Two Col each containing a input select option Form.
- Label 1 - A Single time select option is provided.
- Label 2 - A User can Select multiple option and the selected option will be displayed at the top of input dropdown .
- In Label 2 section we have already given 4 options but we can add more if we want.
- after that we have a Add New Row button at the bottom right corner which adds a new row in the table.
- At last when all the options are selected in the 1st section that is Label1 col, than an alert message will appear i.e "No option available to select for the next row." .


## Features
- We have to select an option in both the label fields, without it we can not proceed further.
- If any of the field is not filled among both then We can't add a New Row ,it will show us an alert "both fields are required."
- In label 2 Section we can add and can select as many options we want to.
