# React + Vite :-
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Run Command :-
- npm install
- npm run dev


## Project Details :
- Two Col each containing a input select option Form.
- Label 1 - A Single time select option is provided.
- Label 2 - A User can Select multiple option and the selected option will be displayed at the top of input dropdown .
- In Label 2 section we have already given 4 options but we can add more if we want.
- after that we have a Add New Row button at the bottom right corner which adds a new row in the table.


## Features
- We have to select an option in both the label fields, without it we can not proceed further.
- If any of the field is not filled among both then We can't add a New Row ,it will show us an alert "both fields are required."
- In label 2 Section we can add as many options we want to.
